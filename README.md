# SFCave
Port of Arduboy SFCave to the Playdate. A classic keep the chopper in the air without hitting the cave walls. Basically flappy bird but long before it was released.

The repo I ported from can be found at this link https://github.com/Slade1972/SFCave

If you just want a build to play on your Playdate that can be found here https://anefiox.itch.io/sfcave
